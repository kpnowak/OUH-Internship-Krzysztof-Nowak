# Fast Feature Selection Alternatives to MRMR

## Overview

This module provides efficient alternatives to MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) feature selection for high-dimensional genomic data, specifically optimized for TCGA multi-omics cancer datasets. These methods offer significant speed improvements while maintaining competitive performance.

## Problem Statement

MRMR, while effective for feature selection, can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional datasets typical in cancer genomics:
- **Gene Expression**: ~20,000 features
- **miRNA**: ~2,000 features  
- **Methylation**: ~27,000 features
- **Sample sizes**: 100-500 samples

The computational complexity of MRMR scales poorly with the number of features, making it a bottleneck in machine learning pipelines.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from fast_feature_selection import FastFeatureSelector

# For regression
selector = FastFeatureSelector(method="variance_f_test", n_features=100)
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train, is_regression=True)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test)

# For classification  
selector = FastFeatureSelector(method="rf_importance", n_features=50)
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train, is_regression=False)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test)
```

### Benchmarking

```python
# Run the benchmark script
python test_fast_feature_selection.py
```

This will generate performance comparison plots and speed vs accuracy trade-off analysis.

## Migration from MRMR

### Step 1: Test with Small Dataset
```python
# Replace MRMR with VarianceFTest for initial testing
# OLD: selector_code = "mrmr_reg" 
# NEW: selector_code = "variance_f_test_reg"
```

### Step 2: Compare Performance
```python
# Run both methods and compare results
mrmr_results = run_with_selector("mrmr_reg", X, y)
fast_results = run_with_selector("variance_f_test_reg", X, y)
print(f"MRMR: {mrmr_results['performance']:.3f}")
print(f"Fast: {fast_results['performance']:.3f}")
print(f"Speedup: {mrmr_results['time'] / fast_results['time']:.1f}x")
```

### Step 3: Update Configuration
```python
# Update your selector dictionaries
REGRESSION_SELECTORS = {
    "FastVarianceF": "variance_f_test_reg",  # New default
    "FastRF": "rf_importance_reg",           # High performance
    "MRMR": "mrmr_reg",                      # Keep for comparison
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Import Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fast_feature_selection'`**
```bash
# Ensure the module is in your Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/your/project"
```

**2. Poor Performance with Chi2FS**
```python
# Chi2 requires non-negative features
# Ensure your data is properly preprocessed
X_positive = np.abs(X)  # or use other methods for negative values
```

**3. Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
```python
# Use more memory-efficient methods for very large datasets
selector = FastFeatureSelector(method="correlation", n_features=100)  # Most memory efficient
```

**4. Inconsistent Results**
```python
# Set random state for reproducible results
selector = FastFeatureSelector(method="rf_importance", n_features=100, random_state=42)
```

## Performance Tips

### For Maximum Speed:
1. Use `correlation` (regression) or `chi2` (classification)
2. Reduce `n_features` to minimum needed
3. Set `variance_threshold` higher (e.g., 0.05) to filter more features

### For Maximum Performance:
1. Use `combined_fast` or `rf_importance`
2. Increase `rf_n_estimators` for Random Forest methods
3. Try multiple methods and ensemble the results

### For Memory Efficiency:
1. Avoid methods that create large intermediate matrices
2. Use `variance_f_test` for good balance
3. Process modalities separately for very large datasets

**Recommendation**: Start with `VarianceFTest` for the best balance of speed and performance, then experiment with `RFImportance` if you need higher accuracy and can afford slightly more computation time.
