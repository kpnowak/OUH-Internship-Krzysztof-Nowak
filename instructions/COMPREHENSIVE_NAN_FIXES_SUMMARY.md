# Comprehensive NaN Handling Fixes Summary

## Problem Description

The system was experiencing persistent **"Input contains NaN" errors** in the AML dataset regression pipeline, causing widespread model training failures across all models (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, ElasticNet) and all cross-validation folds.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the root cause was identified as **pipe-separated values in the AML dataset's outcome column** (`lab_procedure_bone_marrow_blast_cell_outcome_percent_value`). The clinical data contained values like:
- `"85.5|90.2|78.3"` (pipe-separated values)
- `"75.5|invalid|80.2"` (mixed valid/invalid values)
- `"invalid|text"` (non-numeric strings)
- Empty strings and actual NaN values

The existing extraction logic was insufficient and introduced NaN values during the conversion process, which then propagated through the entire pipeline.

## Comprehensive Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Loading (`data_io.py`)

**Location**: `load_dataset()` function, lines 1690-1780

**Key Improvements**:
- **Robust pipe-separated value extraction** with multiple fallback strategies
- **AML-specific aggressive extraction** using regex pattern matching
- **Comprehensive validation** to ensure no NaN values remain
- **Emergency fallback** to median imputation if NaN values persist
- **Infinite value handling** to replace inf/-inf with median

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Enhanced extraction function with better error handling
def extract_max_numeric(value):
    # Validates numeric values, handles pipe-separated strings
    # Uses multiple separators: |, ,, ;, space, tab
    # Extracts maximum value from valid numeric parts
    # Returns NaN only for truly invalid data

# AML-specific aggressive extraction
def aml_aggressive_extract(value):
    # Uses regex to find all numbers in string
    # Returns maximum value for blast cell percentage
    # Handles edge cases specific to AML data format
```

### 2. Enhanced CLI Validation (`cli.py`)

**Location**: `process_dataset()` function, lines 155-185

**Key Improvements**:
- **Detailed NaN counting and logging** for regression datasets
- **AML-specific error detection** with sample ID tracking
- **Verification of cleaning success** with error handling
- **Early termination** if cleaning fails to prevent downstream errors

### 3. Robust Fusion Module NaN Handling (`fusion.py`)

**Location**: Multiple functions in `LateFusionStacking` class

**Key Improvements**:
- **Multi-layer NaN cleaning** in `_generate_meta_features()`
- **Cross-validation split validation** to ensure clean data at each fold
- **Prediction cleaning** to handle NaN values in model outputs
- **Emergency fallback values** when models fail due to data issues

### 4. Enhanced Model Training Safety (`cv.py`)

**Location**: `train_regression_model()` function, lines 1405-1450

**Key Improvements**:
- **Pre-training NaN validation** with detailed logging
- **Input data cleaning** right before model.fit()
- **Target value validation** to ensure numeric consistency

### 5. Fixed K-Neighbors Issues (`fusion.py`, `cv.py`, `mrmr_helper.py`)

**Key Improvements**:
- **Dynamic k_neighbors adjustment** based on available samples
- **SafeSMOTE wrapper** that validates sample counts before oversampling
- **Mutual information parameter validation** for small datasets
- **Automatic fallback strategies** when insufficient samples available

## Testing and Validation
