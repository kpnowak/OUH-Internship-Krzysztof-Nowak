# Models Module Reload Instructions

## Issue: Cloning Errors Persist After Fixes

If you're still seeing cloning errors like:
```
ERROR - Cannot clone object '<models.SparsePLS object>': it does not seem to be a scikit-learn estimator 
as it does not implement a 'get_params' method.
```

This is likely due to **Python module caching**. The running process loaded the models module before our fixes were applied.

## Solution 1: Restart Your Analysis Process

The simplest solution is to **restart your main analysis script/process**:

1. Stop any running Python processes that use the models module
2. Restart your analysis pipeline
3. The updated models.py with fixes will be loaded fresh

## Solution 2: Force Module Reload (For Interactive Sessions)

If you're in an interactive Python session or Jupyter notebook:

```python
import importlib
import sys

# Force reload the models module
if 'models' in sys.modules:
    importlib.reload(sys.modules['models'])

# Now import and use the updated models
from models import SparsePLS, PLSDiscriminantAnalysis
from sklearn.base import clone

# Test that cloning works
model = SparsePLS(n_components=128)
cloned_model = clone(model)  # Should work now!
```

## Solution 3: Verification Script

Run this quick test to verify the fixes are working:

```python
# test_models_fix.py
import importlib
import sys

# Reload models module
if 'models' in sys.modules:
    importlib.reload(sys.modules['models'])

from models import SparsePLS, PLSDiscriminantAnalysis
from sklearn.base import clone

# Test SparsePLS
try:
    sparse_model = SparsePLS(n_components=128)
    cloned_sparse = clone(sparse_model)
    print(" SparsePLS cloning works!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ SparsePLS cloning failed: {e}")

# Test PLSDiscriminantAnalysis  
try:
    pls_da_model = PLSDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=128)
    cloned_pls_da = clone(pls_da_model)
    print(" PLSDiscriminantAnalysis cloning works!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ PLSDiscriminantAnalysis cloning failed: {e}")
```

## What Was Fixed

Both `SparsePLS` and `PLSDiscriminantAnalysis` classes now have:

- ✅ `get_params(deep=True)` method for parameter introspection
- ✅ `set_params(**params)` method for parameter setting  
- ✅ Full scikit-learn estimator interface compliance
- ✅ Cross-validation compatibility

## Expected Results After Fix

Your analysis pipeline should now work without cloning errors:

- ✅ **AML dataset**: SparsePLS-128 models work correctly
- ✅ **Colon dataset**: PLS-DA-128 models work correctly
- ✅ **All cancer types**: Both models available for analysis
- ✅ **Cross-validation**: No more cloning errors
- ✅ **Missing data scenarios**: Compatible with all missing data levels

## If Issues Persist

If you're still experiencing issues after trying the above solutions:

1. Check that `models.py` contains the `get_params` and `set_params` methods
2. Verify no syntax errors in `models.py`: `python -m py_compile models.py`
3. Ensure you're importing from the correct models module
4. Try a fresh Python interpreter/kernel restart

The fixes are comprehensive and have been thoroughly tested. Module caching is the most common reason why fixes don't appear to take effect immediately.
