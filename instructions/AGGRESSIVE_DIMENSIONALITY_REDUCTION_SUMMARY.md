# Aggressive Dimensionality Reduction Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of aggressive dimensionality reduction to address the critical issue of keeping too many features in the genomic data analysis pipeline, as identified in the AML dataset analysis.

## Problem Statement

### Current Feature Counts (Too High)
- **Gene Expression**: 4,987 features (target: 1,000-2,000)
- **miRNA**: 377 features (target: 100-200, too high for 507 samples)
- **Methylation**: 3,956 features (target: ~2,000 with variance-based filtering)

### Issues Identified
1. **Poor sample-to-feature ratios** leading to overfitting risk
2. **Computational inefficiency** with high-dimensional data
3. **Curse of dimensionality** affecting model performance
4. **Insufficient feature selection** in current pipeline

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Function: `aggressive_dimensionality_reduction()`

**Location**: `preprocessing.py` (lines ~2511+)

**Purpose**: Modality-specific aggressive feature reduction with multiple selection strategies.

**Key Features**:
- **Modality-aware targeting**: Different strategies for gene expression, miRNA, and methylation
- **Sample-size adaptation**: Adjusts targets based on sample/feature ratio rules
- **Multi-stage selection**: Combines variance filtering with supervised selection
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Detailed reduction statistics and validation

### 2. Selection Strategies

#### Ultra Aggressive (miRNA)
- **Target**: 377 -> 150 features (100-200 range)
- **Method**: Variance threshold + supervised univariate selection
- **Rationale**: Very aggressive due to small sample size (507 samples)

#### Hybrid Aggressive (Gene Expression)
- **Target**: 4,987 -> 1,500 features (1,000-2,000 range)
- **Method**: Variance pre-filtering -> supervised selection
- **Stages**: 
  1. Variance filtering to 3x target size
  2. Supervised univariate selection to final target

#### Variance Focused (Methylation)
- **Target**: 3,956 -> 2,000 features
- **Method**: Pure variance-based selection as recommended
- **Conservative**: No supervised selection to preserve methylation patterns

#### Hybrid Conservative (Unknown Modalities)
- **Target**: Adaptive based on data size
- **Method**: Conservative variance filtering + ranking
- **Fallback**: Safe approach for unrecognized data types

### 3. Configuration Integration

**Location**: `config.py`

**New Parameters**:
```python
# Global defaults
"use_aggressive_dimensionality_reduction": False
"gene_expression_target": 1500
"mirna_target": 150
"methylation_target": 2000
"dimensionality_selection_method": "hybrid"
"variance_percentile": 75
"enable_supervised_selection": True
```

**Modality-Specific Activation**:
- **miRNA**: Enabled with hybrid selection and supervised features
- **Gene Expression**: Enabled with hybrid selection (1,500 target)
- **Methylation**: Enabled with variance-only selection (2,000 target)

### 4. Pipeline Integration

**Location**: `robust_biomedical_preprocessing_pipeline()` - Step 2a.6

**Integration Points**:
1. **After sparsity handling** (Step 2a.5)
2. **Before variance threshold selection** (Step 2b)
3. **Train/test consistency** maintained through transformer reuse

**Key Features**:
- **Supervised selection**: Uses target variable when available and enabled
- **Test data alignment**: Applies same transformations to maintain consistency
- **Dimension validation**: Ensures train/test feature counts match
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Tracks reduction statistics and validation metrics

## Expected Improvements

### 1. Feature Count Reductions
- **Gene Expression**: 4,987 -> ~1,500 (70% reduction)
- **miRNA**: 377 -> ~150 (60% reduction)
- **Methylation**: 3,956 -> ~2,000 (49% reduction)

### 2. Sample-to-Feature Ratios
- **Before**: Often < 1 (severe overfitting risk)
- **After**: Target â‰¥ 2-5 (reduced overfitting risk)

### 3. Performance Benefits
- **Training speed**: 50-70% faster due to fewer features
- **Memory usage**: Significant reduction in memory requirements
- **Model generalization**: Better performance on test data
- **Cross-validation stability**: More consistent CV scores

### 4. Computational Efficiency
- **Feature selection time**: Optimized multi-stage approach
- **Model training time**: Substantial reduction
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Faster grid/random search

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Selection Methods

#### Variance-Based Selection
```python
# Remove zero variance features
non_zero_var_mask = variances > 1e-10
# Select top features by variance
top_var_indices = np.argsort(variances)[-target_features:]
```

#### Supervised Univariate Selection
```python
# Automatic score function selection
score_func = f_regression if regression else f_classif
# Select k best features
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=score_func, k=target_features)
```

#### Hybrid Multi-Stage
```python
# Stage 1: Variance pre-filtering to 3x target
# Stage 2: Supervised selection to final target
# Combines benefits of both approaches
```

### 2. Train/Test Consistency

**Challenge**: Ensure test data undergoes identical feature selection.

**Solution**: Store and reapply all transformers:
```python
# Store transformers during training
transformers = {
    'variance_filter': mask,
    'univariate_selector': selector,
    'top_variance_indices': indices
}

# Apply to test data
for transformer in transformers:
    X_test = apply_transformer(X_test, transformer)
```

### 3. Validation and Safety

**Sample-Size Rules**:
- Target features < samples/5 (overfitting prevention)
- Minimum 50 features (model complexity)
- Warning if ratio < 2 (high overfitting risk)

**Quality Checks**:
- Dimension matching between train/test
- Feature count validation against targets
- Statistical validation of selected features

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Enable in Configuration
```python
# In config.py or runtime configuration
config = {
    'use_aggressive_dimensionality_reduction': True,
    'gene_expression_target': 1500,  # Adjust as needed
    'mirna_target': 150,
    'methylation_target': 2000,
    'enable_supervised_selection': True
}
```

### 2. Automatic Activation
The feature is automatically enabled for specific modalities in `MODALITY_SPECIFIC_CONFIG`:
- miRNA: Always enabled (critical for small sample size)
- Gene Expression: Enabled by default
- Methylation: Enabled with variance-only selection

### 3. Manual Control
```python
# Disable for specific analysis
config['use_aggressive_dimensionality_reduction'] = False

# Adjust targets based on dataset characteristics
config['gene_expression_target'] = 2000  # More conservative
config['mirna_target'] = 100             # More aggressive
```

## Monitoring and Validation

### 1. Reduction Reports
Each reduction generates comprehensive reports:
```python
{
    'modality_type': 'mirna',
    'initial_features': 377,
    'final_features': 150,
    'reduction_ratio': 0.60,
    'target_achieved': True,
    'sample_to_feature_ratio': 3.38,
    'selection_strategy': 'ultra_aggressive',
    'methods_applied': ['variance_pre_filter', 'ultra_aggressive']
}
```

### 2. Validation Warnings

## Future Enhancements
