## **Key Breakthrough Changes**

### **1. Genomic-Scale Feature Selection**
```python
# BEFORE: Catastrophically small
N_VALUES_LIST = [4, 8, 16, 32]  # Lost all biological signal

# AFTER: Genomic-appropriate scale  
N_VALUES_LIST = [128, 256, 512, 1024]  # Captures biological complexity
```

### **2. Minimal Regularization**
```python
# BEFORE: Over-regularized
ElasticNet(alpha=0.1)     # Destroyed weak genomic signals
Lasso(alpha=0.01)         # Too aggressive
LogisticRegression(C=1.0) # Under-powered

# AFTER: Genomic-optimized
ElasticNet(alpha=0.001)      # 100x less regularization
Lasso(alpha=0.0001)          # 100x less regularization  
LogisticRegression(C=100.0)  # 100x more capacity
```

### **3. High-Capacity Models**
```python
# BEFORE: Insufficient capacity
RandomForest(n_estimators=200, max_depth=12)

# AFTER: Genomic-scale capacity
RandomForest(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=None)  # 5x more trees, unlimited depth
```

### **4. Advanced Feature Selection**
```python
# NEW: GenomicFeatureSelector with ensemble methods
- Biological relevance scoring
- Stability selection with bootstrap
- Multi-method ensemble (5 algorithms)
- Very permissive thresholds (variance: 1e-6)
- Default: 512 features instead of 8
```

## **Biological Insights**

### **Why This Works for Genomic Data**

1. **Distributed Signal**: Genomic patterns span hundreds of genes/features
2. **Weak Effects**: Individual features have small but cumulative effects
3. **Pathway Complexity**: Biological pathways involve many interacting components
4. **Sparse Expression**: Many genes are zero in many samples (normal)

### **Traditional ML vs Genomic ML**

| Aspect | Traditional ML | Genomic ML (Our Approach) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Feature Count** | Few (8-32) | Many (128-1024) |
| **Regularization** | Strong | Minimal |
| **Model Complexity** | Simple | High-capacity |
| **Feature Selection** | Aggressive | Permissive |
| **Signal Type** | Strong, localized | Weak, distributed |

## **Next Steps for Further Improvement**

### **For Regression (to reach R² ≥ 0.5)**

1. **Test with n_features=128** (your current test case)
   ```bash
   # Run with smallest new feature count
   python main.py --dataset AML --n-val 128
   ```

2. **If still poor, try larger feature sets**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --dataset AML --n-val 256
   python main.py --dataset AML --n-val 512
   ```

3. **Consider even more permissive settings**:
   - Reduce regularization further (alpha=0.0001 -> 0.00001)
   - Increase model capacity (n_estimators=1000 -> 2000)
   - Use ensemble methods (combine multiple models)

### **For Classification (already excellent)**
- Current performance exceeds targets
- Consider testing on real datasets to confirm
- May want to tune for specific cancer types
