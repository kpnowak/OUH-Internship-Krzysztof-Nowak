## Problem Summary

The system was experiencing persistent **"Input contains NaN" errors** that were causing widespread model training failures, particularly in the AML dataset regression pipeline. Despite multiple previous attempts to fix NaN handling, the errors continued to occur at the exact moment of model training (`model.fit(X_train, y_train)`).

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the root cause was identified as **NaN values slipping through the data processing pipeline** at multiple critical points:

1. **Data Loading**: Pipe-separated values in AML dataset's outcome column
2. **Feature Extraction**: Some extractors (ICA, PLS) can produce NaN values during transformation
3. **Cross-Validation Splitting**: NaN values being introduced during CV splits
4. **Model Training**: Final gap where NaN values reached `model.fit()` calls

## Emergency Fixes Implemented

### 🚨 **Critical Fix 1: Emergency NaN Detection at Model Training**

**Location**: `fusion.py` - `LateFusionStacking._generate_meta_features()`

Added **emergency NaN detection and cleaning** right before `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`:

```python
# CRITICAL: Final NaN check right before model.fit - this is where the error occurs
if np.isnan(X_train).any():
    logger.error(f"EMERGENCY: NaN values detected in X_train right before model.fit")
    X_train = np.nan_to_num(X_train, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)

if np.isnan(y_train).any():
    logger.error(f"EMERGENCY: NaN values detected in y_train right before model.fit")
    y_train_median = np.nanmedian(y_train) if not np.isnan(y_train).all() else 0.0
    y_train = np.nan_to_num(y_train, nan=y_train_median, posinf=y_train_median, neginf=y_train_median)
```

### 🚨 **Critical Fix 2: Enhanced Feature Extractor NaN Handling**

**Location**: `models.py` - `cached_fit_transform_extractor_regression()` and `cached_fit_transform_extractor_classification()`

Added **comprehensive NaN validation** before and after extractor training:

```python
# CRITICAL: Final NaN check and cleaning before extractor training
if np.isnan(X_safe).any():
    logger.warning(f"CRITICAL: NaN values detected before {type(new_extractor).__name__} training")
    X_safe = np.nan_to_num(X_safe, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)

# CRITICAL: Check if the extractor produced NaN values
if np.isnan(X_transformed).any():
    logger.error(f"CRITICAL: {type(new_extractor).__name__} produced NaN values")
    X_transformed = np.nan_to_num(X_transformed, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)
```

### 🚨 **Critical Fix 3: Enhanced Data Loading NaN Handling**

**Location**: `data_io.py` - `load_dataset()`

Enhanced **pipe-separated value extraction** for AML dataset:

```python
# Enhanced extraction function with better error handling
def extract_max_numeric(value):
    # Handle pipe-separated values like "85.5|90.2|78.3"
    # Extract maximum numeric value with robust error handling
    # Apply AML-specific aggressive extraction using regex
```

### 🚨 **Critical Fix 4: Enhanced Model Training NaN Handling**

**Location**: `cv.py` - `train_regression_model()`

Added **pre-training NaN validation**:

```python
# Critical NaN safety check before any processing
if np.isnan(X_train).any():
    logger.warning("NaN values detected in X_train, cleaning...")
    X_train = np.nan_to_num(X_train, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)
```

### 🚨 **Critical Fix 5: K-Neighbors Parameter Fixes**

**Location**: `fusion.py`, `mrmr_helper.py`, `cv.py`

Fixed **"Expected n_neighbors <= n_samples_fit" errors**:

```python
# Fix KNNImputer
max_neighbors = max(1, X.shape[0] - 1)
safe_neighbors = min(self.k_neighbors, max_neighbors)

# Fix SMOTE
safe_neighbors = min(k_neighbors, max(1, min_class_size - 1))

# Fix mutual_info functions
safe_neighbors = min(n_neighbors, max(1, n_samples - 1))
```

**Recommended Actions**:
- Monitor logs for emergency NaN cleaning frequency
- Investigate data sources if emergency cleaning becomes frequent
- Consider data preprocessing improvements for problematic datasets
