# Biomedical Data Analysis Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to handle biomedical data characteristics, specifically addressing the poor performance issues observed in TCGA-like datasets with high dimensionality, sparsity, and small sample sizes.

## Key Issues Identified

### Original Performance Problems
- **Classification**: MCC scores around 0 or negative, accuracy ~0.5 (random chance)
- **Regression**: R² scores mostly negative (-0.05 to -1.5), indicating worse than mean predictor
- **Root Causes**: 
  - Aggressive feature selection losing informative features
  - Poor model regularization for high-dimensional data
  - Inadequate preprocessing for sparse biomedical data
  - Suboptimal cross-validation for small samples

### Dataset Characteristics
- **High dimensionality**: 1000s-10000s of features
- **Small sample sizes**: ~100-400 samples
- **Extreme sparsity**: 60-90% zero values (gene expression)
- **Heterogeneous modalities**: Gene expression, miRNA, methylation
- **Class imbalance**: Uneven target distribution
- **Technical noise**: Batch effects, outliers

## Comprehensive Solution Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Configuration (`config.py`)

#### Biomedical-Specific Parameters
```python
# Optimized for sparse, high-dimensional data
N_VALUES_LIST = [8, 16, 32, 64]  # Conservative feature selection
MAX_VARIABLE_FEATURES = 5000     # Reduced from 10000
MAX_COMPONENTS = 32              # Reduced from 64
MAX_FEATURES = 32                # Reduced from 64

# Preprocessing thresholds
PREPROCESSING_CONFIG = {
    "variance_threshold": 0.001,      # Very low for sparse data
    "correlation_threshold": 0.98,    # High to retain informative features
    "missing_threshold": 0.5,         # Lenient for biomedical data
    "outlier_threshold": 4.0,         # More tolerant of outliers
    "log_transform": True,            # Handle skewed distributions
    "quantile_normalize": True,       # Robust normalization
}

# Cross-validation for small samples
CV_CONFIG = {
    "min_samples_per_fold": 10,
    "max_cv_splits": 3,
    "min_samples_per_class_per_fold": 5,
    "repeated_cv": True,
    "n_repeats": 5,
}
```

#### Model Optimizations
- **RandomForest**: Reduced complexity (max_depth: 8, min_samples_leaf: 3, n_estimators: 200)
- **LogisticRegression**: L1 penalty with liblinear solver, stronger regularization (C: 0.1)
- **ElasticNet/Lasso**: Increased regularization (alpha: 1.0/0.1)
- **SVM**: RBF kernel with balanced class weights

### 2. Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline (`preprocessing.py`)

#### Biomedical-Specific Preprocessing
```python
def biomedical_preprocessing_pipeline(X, y=None, config=None):
    """
    Comprehensive preprocessing for biomedical data:
    1. Missing value imputation (median strategy)
    2. Log transformation for skewed distributions
    3. Sparse feature handling
    4. Variance-based filtering
    5. Outlier detection and treatment
    6. Quantile normalization
    7. Correlation-based filtering
    """
```

#### Key Features
- **Log transformation**: Handles skewed gene expression data
- **Quantile normalization**: Robust to outliers and batch effects
- **Sparse-aware processing**: Preserves sparsity structure
- **Outlier handling**: Z-score based detection with capping
- **Feature filtering**: Multi-stage filtering (variance, correlation, missing values)

### 3. Specialized Feature Selection (`fast_feature_selection.py`)

#### Biomedical Feature Selection Methods
```python
def biomedical_feature_selection(X, y, method='combined'):
    """
    Methods:
    - combined: Ensemble of multiple methods with rank aggregation
    - stability: Bootstrap-based stability selection
    - sparse_aware: Sparsity-aware selection for biomedical data
    - univariate: Standard statistical tests
    """
```

#### Ensemble Approach
1. **Univariate tests**: F-statistics for initial screening
2. **Mutual information**: Non-linear relationships
3. **Random Forest importance**: Tree-based feature importance
4. **L1 regularization**: Sparse linear models
5. **Rank aggregation**: Combines all methods robustly

#### Sparse-Aware Selection
- Considers sparsity patterns in feature selection
- Analyzes non-zero value distributions
- Computes target correlation for informative regions
- Balances sparsity, variance, and predictive power

### 4. Adaptive Cross-Validation (`cv.py`)

#### Smart CV Strategy
```python
def get_cv_strategy(X, y, task_type='classification'):
    """
    Adaptive CV based on sample size:
    - Very small (<30): LeaveOneOut
    - Small (30-100): 2-3 fold StratifiedKFold
    - Medium (>100): Standard k-fold with repeats
    """
```

#### Features
- **Sample size adaptation**: Adjusts splits based on data size
- **Class balance preservation**: Stratified splits for classification
- **Repeated CV**: Multiple repeats for robust estimates
- **Validation checks**: Ensures sufficient samples per fold

### 5. Enhanced Data Loading (`data_io.py`)

#### Integrated Pipeline
```python
def load_and_preprocess_data(dataset_name, task_type, 
                           apply_biomedical_preprocessing=True):
    """
    Complete data loading with:
    1. Raw data loading
    2. Biomedical preprocessing
    3. Advanced filtering
    4. Data validation
    5. Sparsity analysis
    """
```
