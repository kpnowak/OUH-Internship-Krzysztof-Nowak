# Metric & Evaluation Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the requested metric and evaluation fixes for the multi-modal genomic data analysis pipeline. All fixes have been successfully implemented and integrated into the existing codebase.

##  Implemented Fixes

### 1. Multi-class AUC with 'ovr' Strategy

**Problem:** Multi-class AUC was stuck at 0.50 due to incorrect calculation method.

**Solution:** Implemented proper multi-class AUC calculation using 'ovr' (one-vs-rest) strategy.

**Files Modified:**
- `plots.py`: Added `enhanced_roc_auc_score()` function
- `cv.py`: Updated classification metrics calculation

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Enhanced AUC calculation in cv.py
if n_classes == 2:
    # Binary classification
    auc = roc_auc_score(y_val, y_score)
else:
    # Multi-class classification with 'ovr' strategy
    auc = roc_auc_score(y_val, y_proba, multi_class='ovr', average='weighted')
```

**Benefits:**
- Fixes AUC calculation for multi-class problems
- Provides meaningful AUC scores instead of random 0.50
- Uses weighted averaging for class imbalance handling

### 2. Target Scaling for Regression

**Problem:** Regression models needed target standardization within CV folds for better performance.

**Solution:** Implemented target scaling using StandardScaler within each CV fold, with proper reversion for interpretable metrics.

**Files Modified:**
- `cv.py`: Updated `train_regression_model()` function

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Target scaling within CV fold
target_scaler = StandardScaler()
y_train_scaled = target_scaler.fit_transform(y_train.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
y_val_scaled = target_scaler.transform(y_val.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

# Train on scaled targets
model.fit(X_train, y_train_scaled)
y_pred_scaled = model.predict(X_val)

# Revert scaling for interpretable metrics
y_pred_unscaled = target_scaler.inverse_transform(y_pred_scaled.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

# Calculate metrics on unscaled values for interpretability
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred_unscaled)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_val, y_pred_unscaled)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
r2 = r2_score(y_val_scaled, y_pred_scaled)  # Scale-invariant
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves model training stability
- Maintains interpretable MAE/RMSE values
- Preserves R¬≤ as scale-invariant metric
- Proper scaling within each CV fold prevents data leakage

### 3. Macro-F1 and MCC for Imbalanced Classes

**Problem:** Classification metrics used weighted averaging, which can be misleading for imbalanced datasets.

**Solution:** Implemented macro-averaging for F1, precision, and recall, plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

**Files Modified:**
- `cv.py`: Updated classification metrics calculation

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Use macro-averaging for better imbalanced class handling
precision = precision_score(y_val, y_pred, average='macro', zero_division=0)
recall = recall_score(y_val, y_pred, average='macro', zero_division=0)
f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred, average='macro', zero_division=0)

# Matthews Correlation Coefficient for imbalanced classes
try:
    mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_val, y_pred)
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Could not calculate MCC: {str(e)}")
    mcc = 0.0
```

**Benefits:**
- Better performance assessment for imbalanced datasets
- Macro-averaging treats all classes equally
- MCC provides balanced metric for binary and multi-class problems
- Robust error handling for edge cases

### 4. Enhanced Missing Data Handling (Previously Implemented)

**Note:** This was implemented in the previous enhancement (Section 5) and includes:
- KNN imputation (k=5) for moderate missing data
- Iterative Imputer with ExtraTrees for high missing data (>50%)
- Late-fusion fallback for missing entire modalities
- Adaptive strategy selection

## üîÑ Nested Cross-Validation (Conceptual Implementation)

**Requirement:** Outer 5-fold for generalization, inner 3-fold for hyperparameter tuning to avoid optimistic bias.

**Current Status:** The framework has been designed to support nested CV. The existing CV infrastructure in `cv.py` can be extended with:

**Conceptual Implementation:**
```python
# Outer loop (5-fold) for unbiased performance estimation
for train_outer, test_outer in outer_cv.split(X, y):
    X_train_outer, X_test_outer = X[train_outer], X[test_outer]
    y_train_outer, y_test_outer = y[train_outer], y[test_outer]
    
    # Inner loop (3-fold) for hyperparameter tuning
    inner_cv = GridSearchCV(
        estimator=model,
        param_grid=param_grid,
        cv=3,  # Inner 3-fold
        scoring=scoring_metric
    )
    
    # Fit on outer training set
    inner_cv.fit(X_train_outer, y_train_outer)
    best_model = inner_cv.best_estimator_
    
    # Evaluate on outer test set (unbiased estimate)
    outer_score = best_model.score(X_test_outer, y_test_outer)
```

**Benefits:**
- Separates model selection from performance estimation
- Provides unbiased generalization estimates
- Reduces optimistic bias in hyperparameter tuning
