### üìã Integration Strategy
- **Weighted Concatenation** emerges as the most effective fusion technique
- Simple fusion methods (sum, average) show moderate effectiveness
- Early fusion with PCA shows limited benefit

### üîç Dataset-Specific Insights
- **Colon cancer** classification significantly outperforms breast cancer
- Higher missing data percentages may reveal more discriminative patterns
- Feature selection algorithms (XGBoostFS, fclassifFS) excel in challenging scenarios

### ‚ö° Performance vs. Speed
- **SVC models** provide the best MCC scores with minimal training time
- **RandomForest** models require significantly more training time
- **LogisticRegression** offers fast training but lower peak performance

### Methodology
The analysis employs MCC as the primary metric due to its robustness in evaluating binary classification performance, especially in imbalanced datasets common in medical applications. MCC values range from -1 (total disagreement) to +1 (perfect prediction), with 0 representing random performance.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that **LogisticL1 feature selection combined with SVM classification** achieves the highest MCC performance (0.4704) while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency. The surprising effectiveness of high missing data scenarios suggests that sparse representations may enhance discriminative power in multi-omics cancer classification tasks.
