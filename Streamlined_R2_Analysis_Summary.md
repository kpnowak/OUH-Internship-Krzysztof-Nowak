## üèÜ Top 10 Performance Summary

| Rank | R¬≤ Score | Algorithm | Model | Features | Missing % | Time (s) |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | -0.0731 | PLS | RandomForestRegressor | 16 | 0.5% | 5.67 |
| 2 | -0.0811 | LASSO | RandomForestRegressor | 8 | 0.0% | 8.92 |
| 3 | -0.0876 | LASSO | RandomForestRegressor | 32 | 0.0% | 10.58 |
| 4 | -0.0935 | ICA | RandomForestRegressor | 32 | 0.0% | 7.85 |
| 5 | -0.0939 | ICA | LinearRegression | 32 | 0.5% | 0.002 |

## üìà Missing Data Impact Analysis

| Missing % | Experiments | Average R¬≤ | Std Dev |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 0.0% | 324 | -3,077,687 | 33,839,574 |
| 0.2% | 81 | -2,001,649 | 8,951,109 |
| 0.5% | 81 | -6,755,671 | 44,883,241 |

## ‚ö° Training Time Insights

- **Fastest Algorithm**: ICA + LinearRegression (0.002 seconds)
- **Slowest Algorithm**: LASSO + RandomForestRegressor (10.58 seconds)
- **Average Training Time**: 5.10 seconds
- **Speed vs Performance**: No clear correlation - fastest isn't always best

## üé® Text Wrapping Implementation

### Problem Solved:
- **Before**: Long model names (e.g., "RandomForestRegressor") extended beyond table boundaries
- **After**: Names are wrapped using `textwrap` module with 15-character width limits

### Wrapping Strategy:
```python
def wrap_text(text, width=15):
    return '\n'.join(textwrap.wrap(str(text), width=width))
```

### Applied To:
- Algorithm names (12-character width)
- Model names (15-character width)  
- Integration techniques (12-character width)

## üìÅ Files Generated

1. **`streamlined_r2_analysis.png`** - Main visualization with 3 focused plots
2. **`streamlined_top_10_analysis.csv`** - Detailed metrics for top performers
3. **`missing_data_impact_analysis.csv`** - Missing data impact statistics

## üîç Key Insights

### Best Performing Combinations:
1. **PLS + RandomForestRegressor** with 16 features performs best
2. **LASSO + RandomForestRegressor** consistently in top 3
3. **ICA algorithms** show good performance across different configurations

### Missing Data Effects:
- **0.2% missing data** shows surprisingly better average performance
- **0.5% missing data** has the worst average performance
- **0.0% missing data** falls in the middle

### Training Efficiency:
- **LinearRegression** models train fastest (0.002-0.023 seconds)
- **RandomForestRegressor** takes longer but often performs better
- **Training time does not correlate with performance quality**

## üéØ Clean Design Features
